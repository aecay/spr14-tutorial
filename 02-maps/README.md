# Mapping in R

Open the `maps.Rmd` file in RStudio and knit it.  **Important:** You
must have downloaded the whole repo (by git clone or
[this link](https://github.com/aecay/spr14-tutorial/archive/master.zip));
not just the Rmd file.

Alternatively, you can download the `maps.html` file and view it.  But
this is cheating: only do this if you cannot get the document to knit.

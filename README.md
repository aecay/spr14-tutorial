# Spring 2014 tutoRial

This github repository hosts the files used in the Spring 2014
technology study group in Penn’s linguistics department.  The name of
this group is the “tutoRial,” but all topics related to the use of
technology in linguistics research are germane, including R, Python, and
LaTeX.

It is hoped that this repository will serve as a lesson in collaboration
itself.  Group members (and members of the general public) are
encouraged to make pull requests or open issues if they would like to
contribute information or correct errors.

## Lessons

The lessons in this group so far are:

1. Literate programming (Mar. 17, 2014)
2. Maps in R (Mar. 24, 2014)
